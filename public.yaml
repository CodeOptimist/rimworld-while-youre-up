intro: |-
  Vanilla's opportunistic hauling, only better. Although patched for compatibility, [i]While You're Up[/i] has not changed since 1.0 integrated it. This mod is a direct replacement. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.

  A replacement for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544626521][i]kevlou's[/i] While You're Up[/url]. Ludeon added opportunistic hauling in 1.0; this mod improves it.

  Vanilla requires a haulable be near your [b]start[/b] position, and its stockpile near your job. Too far and it won't be hauled, [i]even if it's directly in your path[/i]. We can do better.

  [h1]Report Bugs[/h1]
  1. Please save a game when it occurs, then reload to verify it reoccurs (if not you may need to save seconds [i]before[/i] it happens).
  2. Test with JoO disabled from options. Also try disabling the PUAH mod (requires restart).
  3. Send me this save game ([i]Files -> Open save folder[/i] from Debug log), with a download link or through [url={global_discord}]Discord[/url].
  
  It's okay if you have a ton of mods, though the fewer the better.
  This method will save me hours upon hours of setup and get issues fixed quickly.

  [h1]Background[/h1]
  I began with the intention to fork While You're Up, until I saw the improved version Ludeon added to the core game. Since WYU appears discontinued, and this in its spirit, I hope to get away with carrying on the name ♥.
  
  These (now adjustable) settings show [url=https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1000305627047582524/6DCE6BD8630614062AADAFAF2C441451BADCDFCF/]how vanilla does opportunistic hauling[/url].
  And for those curious, here are the [url=https://i.imgur.com/eRSl8t0.png]settings for the original While You're Up[/url] (not recommended).
  
  Although tighter than vanilla's, these fewer checks gave his mod extra hauling opportunities even on 1.0, though it triggered on a shorter hardcoded list of jobs.
  Now that these checks are merely [i]preferred[/i], and we trigger for all jobs, it's the best of both worlds!
  
  (If you set [i]allowOpportunisticPrefix[/i] to [i]false[/i] for a JobDef, it won't allow opportunistic jobs. This is a vanilla feature.)

      Custom control of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279012058]Pick Up And Haul[/url] (installed separately)!

      [1.2] Job description will be "Opportunistically gathering", otherwise it's normal PUAH or a different mod.

      Only items qualifying as opportunistic will be hauled: solves issue with spread-out stockpiles and [url=https://youtu.be/97aNVniNlGE]unloading madness[/url].
      (Dedicated haul jobs behave as normal, gathering as much as they can.)

    desc: |-
      Don't take jobs of opportunity when bleeding.
      "Optimize" settings still apply since they (hopefully) facilitate normal jobs.
    settings:
      - name: skipIfBleeding

  - title: More hauling opportunities
    desc: |-
      By default prefers the proximity requirements set by vanilla, but relaxes them to find valid haulables. Adjustable for performance.
    at: 1.0.0
    settings:
    - name: haulProximities
      title: Haulable & storage initial closeness
      desc: |-
        For performance reasons vanilla doesn't calculate and sort all haul paths, instead it settles for the first found with a haulable near our starting position, and its storage near our job destination. I've made these parameters configurable (marked with ¹).

        Since other parameters do well in limiting travel distance (marked with ²) we can change this from a requirement to simply a preference for closer hauls.

        If performance is an issue, set this stricter to reduce available hauls.
        If straight-line distance poorly represents your actual haul paths, set this stricter and adjust "max region look count"¹.

  - title: Optimize hauling ingredients
    at: 1.6.0
    desc: |-
      If hauling ingredients to storage would bring them closer to their workbench, do that first (grabbing extra).
      
      Disables similar setting in [i]Common Sense[/i] mod.

      • Fixed "Optimize hauling ingredients" to no longer cause pawn "Standing". Thanks helpers ♥.

  - at: 1.5.1
    desc: |-
      • Compatibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1233893175][i]KV's[/i] Infinite Storage[/url]: [i]Optimize hauling supplies[/i] should now work instead of looping on storage and retrieval.

  - at: 1.5.0
    desc: |-
      • New job descriptions:
      |img:jobReport|caption:If you don't see this, it's standard hauling or a different mod.|
      • Added [i]Enabled[/i] setting for troubleshooting without restarts.
      • Improved settings and descriptions.

  - at: 1.2.0
    desc: |-
      • Hauls are substantially improved on the default "recommended" setting. No longer should distant wood cut or metal mined be neglected.
      (I've integrated the very last vanilla pathing check into this mod's magic.)

      • Setting tooltips updated with detailed descriptions.

  - at: 1.1.0
    desc: |-
      • Updated [i]Optimize hauling supplies[/i]
      Now works as expected: instead of denying the inefficient supply job so [i]some[/i] hauler [i]eventually[/i] hauls, the builder themselves will.

          Off is equivalent to disabling all features, resetting each vanilla parameter, and "initial closeness" set to "(vanilla)".

          This parameter limits our actual pathing.
          To understand it, enable [i]Development mode → inspector icon → Visibility → Draw Regions[/i].
          
          Exploration begins from the start region spreading out to all neighbors until encountering the destination region. This setting caps the total number explored - even those in the wrong direction.
          
          It can't be calculated perfectly from distance, as regions will vary in size and neighbors. (A corridor has only forward and back, so they're explored further.)
          But in a completely open field, if a pawn must travel the distance of n=3 full-sized 12x12 regions (~36 tiles), the algorithm will explore 2(n^2+n)+1 or 25 regions.
