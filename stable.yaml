intro: |-
  [b]Opportunistic hauling; haul-to-inventory improvements (if [i]Pick Up And Haul[/i] is installed).[/b]
  A must-have with PUAH. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.

  Recognizing this mod: "on the way to", "closer to", "Efficiently unloading".

  80% of this mod is improving [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279012058]Pick Up And Haul[/url] (optional; installed separately). If you already use PUAH, you want this mod too.

  "But my pawns are walking farther!"
  Yes. A slightly longer journey now to avoid a [i]much[/i] longer journey next time.

footer: |-
  [h1]Compatibility[/h1]
  [i]Common Sense?[/i] Yes. (I prevent incompatible settings from being on at the same time.)

  [i]@Modders:[/i] if you set [i]allowOpportunisticPrefix[/i] to [i]false[/i] for a JobDef, it won't allow opportunistic jobs. This is a vanilla feature.

  [h1]Performance[/h1]
  Vanilla's opportunistic hauling was well-optimized for performance, which this mod painstakingly preserves in its enhancements.
  Likewise we aggressively cache all haul destination lookups for all features, even base Pick Up And Haul.

  [h1]Known Issues[/h1]
  [i]• Pawns not taking into account travel time around walls.[/i]
  Unfortunately this is a consequence of the straight-line "as the crow flies" math in the vanilla code for opportunities. If this is a huge problem for your map, set [i]Haulable & storage initial closeness[/i] to a stricter setting. Your pawns will find less opportunities.
  This is how vanilla mitigates the problem while still being performant. A good solution is for me to add an option for true pathfinding for those whose machines can handle it.
  Alternatively, build a door. 😉

  [i]• Hauling resources to storage despite no extras.[/i]
  Only an issue with Pick Up And Haul. Unfortunately predicting what PUAH will find or altering it when it doesn't find extras requires complex and ugly hacks.
  A true solution requires replacing (rather than patching) PUAH.

  [h1]Report Bugs[/h1]
  1. Please save a game when it occurs, then reload to verify it reoccurs.
  2. Disable the mod from its own options menu - did the bug stop? If so...
  3. Send me your save ([i]Options → Open save data folder[/i]). (They zip much smaller.)
  [b]I can now fix your bug in [i]days[/i] instead of [i]months[/i]! 🎉🥳[/b]

  [h1]History[/h1]
  I intended to [url=https://gist.github.com/CodeOptimist/5a740dd803fc370ec43f22ffa8bc953d#file-utils-cs-L48]fork[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544626521]While You're Up[/url], until I saw [url=https://github.com/CodeOptimist/rimworld-jobs-of-opportunity/blob/29391b0a075a1dd77d4788777b0137e26390328c/Source/Patch_TryOpportunisticJob.cs]RimWorld 1.0 added it[/url]. This mod improves vanilla's integration, and so is a spiritual successor to [i]While You're Up[/i] 💜.

      Exploration begins from the start region spreading out to all neighbors until encountering the destination region. This setting caps the total number explored - even those in the wrong direction.

      It can't be calculated perfectly from distance, as regions will vary in size and neighbors. (A corridor has only forward and back, so they're explored further.)
      But in a completely open field, if a pawn must travel the distance of n=3 full-sized 12x12 regions (~36 tiles), the algorithm will explore 2(n^2+n)+1 or 25 regions.
