intro: |-
  [b]Opportunistic hauling; haul-to-inventory improvements (if [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279012058]Pick Up And Haul[/url] is installed).[/b]
  A must-have with PUAH. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.

  Recognizing this mod: "on the way to", "closer to", "Efficiently unloading".

  }
  
  Much of this mod is improving [i]Pick Up And Haul[/i] (optional; installed separately). If you already use PUAH, you want this mod too.

  "But my pawns are walking farther!"
  Yes. A slightly longer journey now to avoid a [i]much[/i] longer journey next time.

  [h1]Compatibility[/h1]
  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1561769193][i]Common Sense[/i][/url]? Yes. (I prevent incompatible settings from being on at the same time.)
  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896][i]LWM's Deep Storage[/i][/url]? Yes. But off by default for [i]Opportunities[/i] because storing items takes time.
  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341486509][i]Perfect Pathfinding[/i][/url]? I expect WYU's [i]Pathfinding[/i] setting to be compatible, but haven't tested.

  [i]@Modders:[/i] if you set [i]allowOpportunisticPrefix[/i] to [i]false[/i] for a JobDef, it won't allow opportunistic jobs. This is a vanilla feature.


  [h1]Performance[/h1]
  Vanilla's opportunistic hauling was well-optimized for performance, which this mod painstakingly preserves in its enhancements.
  Likewise we aggressively cache all haul destination lookups for all features, even base Pick Up And Haul.


  [h1]Known Issues[/h1]
  [i]• Hauling resources to storage ("closer to") despite no extras.[/i]
  Will occasionally happen with Pick Up And Haul. Not easily fixed.


  [h1]Report Bugs[/h1]
  1. Please save a game when it occurs, then reload to verify it reoccurs.
  2. Disable the mod from its own options menu - did the bug stop? If so...
  3. Send me your save ([i]Options → Open save data folder[/i]). (They zip much smaller.)
  [b]I can now fix your bug in [i]days[/i] instead of [i]months[/i]! 🎉🥳[/b]


  [h1]History[/h1]
  I intended to [url=https://gist.github.com/CodeOptimist/5a740dd803fc370ec43f22ffa8bc953d#file-utils-cs-L48]fork[/url] the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544626521]While You're Up[/url], until I saw [url=https://github.com/CodeOptimist/rimworld-jobs-of-opportunity/blob/29391b0a075a1dd77d4788777b0137e26390328c/Source/Patch_TryOpportunisticJob.cs]RimWorld 1.0 added it[/url]. This mod improves vanilla's integration, and so is a spiritual successor to the original [i]While You're Up[/i] 💜.

      Exploration begins from the start region spreading out to all neighbors until encountering the destination region. This setting caps the total number explored - even those in the wrong direction.

      It can't be calculated perfectly from distance, as regions will vary in size and neighbors. (A corridor has only forward and back, so they're explored further.)
      But in a completely open field, if a pawn must travel the distance of n=3 full-sized 12x12 regions (~36 tiles), the algorithm will explore 2(n^2+n)+1 or 25 regions.
