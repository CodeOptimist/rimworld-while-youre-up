  [b]A pawn's job will say "Opportunistically", "Optimally", or "Efficiently unloading", otherwise it's a different mod[/b] (e.g. normal hauling; normal hauling with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279012058]Pick Up And Haul[/url], or triggered by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1561769193]Common Sense[/url]).

  [i]@Modders:[/i] if you set [i]allowOpportunisticPrefix[/i] to [i]false[/i] for a JobDef, it won't allow opportunistic jobs. This is a vanilla feature.

  [h1]Report Bugs[/h1]
  1. Please save a game when it occurs, then reload to verify it reoccurs (if not you may need to save seconds [i]before[/i] it happens).
  2. Disable JoO from options (no restart). Perhaps disable PUAH (requires restart). Reload game.
  3. If the bug doesn't reoccur, send me this save game ([i]Files -> Open save folder[/i] from [url=https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Testing_mods#Development_mode]Debug log[/url]), via a link or through [url={discord}]Discord[/url].

  It's okay if you have a ton of mods, though the fewer the better.
  This method will save me hours upon hours of setup and get issues fixed quickly.

  [h1]Background[/h1]
  I began with the intention to [url=https://gist.github.com/CodeOptimist/5a740dd803fc370ec43f22ffa8bc953d#file-utils-cs-L48]fork[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544626521][i]kevlou's[/i] While You're Up[/url], until I saw the [url=https://github.com/CodeOptimist/rimworld-jobs-of-opportunity/blob/29391b0a075a1dd77d4788777b0137e26390328c/Source/Patch_TryOpportunisticJob.cs]improved version Ludeon added[/url] to the core game. Since WYU is discontinued, and this in its spirit, I hope to carry on the name ♥.

  These (now adjustable) settings show [url=https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1000305627047582524/6DCE6BD8630614062AADAFAF2C441451BADCDFCF/]how vanilla does opportunistic hauling[/url].
  And for those curious, here are the [url=https://i.imgur.com/eRSl8t0.png]settings for the original While You're Up[/url] (not recommended).

  Although tighter than vanilla's, these fewer checks gave his mod extra hauling opportunities even on 1.0, though it triggered on a [url=https://gist.github.com/CodeOptimist/5a740dd803fc370ec43f22ffa8bc953d#file-hauladder-cs-L44]hardcoded list of jobs[/url].
  Now that these checks are merely [i]preferred[/i], and we trigger for all jobs, it's the best of both worlds!

features:
  - title: Efficient unloading
    at: 2.0.0
    desc: |-
      Custom modification of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279012058]Pick Up And Haul[/url]. (Optional mod. Installed separately.)

      We now control PUAH to eliminate chaotic unloading between stockpiles.
      This also means more hauling opportunities on the way to a separate job.

  - title: Haul to inventory
    at: 1.4.0
    desc: |-
      Custom use of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279012058]Pick Up And Haul[/url]! (Optional mod. Installed separately.)

      PUAH is carefully controlled so only items qualifying as opportunistic will be gathered.
      (Dedicated haul jobs behave as normal, gathering as much as they can.)

  - title: More hauling opportunities
    at: 1.0.0
    desc: |-
      Vanilla requires a haulable be near your [b]start[/b] position, and its stockpile near your job. Too far and it won't be hauled, [i]even if it's directly in your path[/i]. We can do better.

      We prefer the proximity requirements set by vanilla, but relax them to find valid haulables. Adjustable for performance (see tooltips).

  - title: Optimize hauling ingredients
    at: 1.6.0
    desc: |-
      If hauling ingredients to storage would bring them closer to their workbench, do that first (grabbing extra).

      Unticks similar setting in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1561769193]Common Sense[/url] mod.

      If hauling supplies to storage would bring them closer to their blueprint, do that first (grabbing extra).

updates:
  - at: 1.0.0
    desc: |-
      • Support for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279012058][i]Mehni's[/i] Pick Up And Haul[/url]!

  - at: 1.1.0
    desc: |-
      • Updated [i]Optimize hauling supplies[/i]
      Now works as expected: instead of denying the inefficient supply job so [i]some[/i] hauler [i]eventually[/i] hauls, the builder themselves will.

  - at: 1.2.0
    desc: |-
      • Hauls are substantially improved on the default "recommended" setting. No longer should distant wood cut or metal mined be neglected.
      (I've integrated the very last vanilla pathing check into this mod's magic.)

      • Setting tooltips updated with detailed descriptions.

  - at: 1.5.0
    desc: |-
      • New job descriptions:
      |img:jobReport|caption:If you don't see this, it's standard hauling or a different mod.|
      • Added [i]Enabled[/i] setting for troubleshooting without restarts.
      • Improved settings and descriptions.

  - at: 1.5.1
    credit: https://steamcommunity.com/id/SakenW
    desc: |-
      • Compatibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1233893175][i]KV's[/i] Infinite Storage[/url]: [i]Optimize hauling supplies[/i] should now work instead of looping on storage and retrieval.

  - at: 1.6.1
    credit: '@Gwyndolin-chan#8975'
    desc: |-
      • Fixed "Optimize hauling ingredients" to no longer cause "Standing" loop when incapable. (Missed a basic check vanilla already did in the "Optimize hauling supplies" scenario.)

  - at: 1.6.2
    credit: '@Just#1021'
    desc: |-
      • Fixed "Optimize hauling ingredients/supplies" to no longer cause "Standing" loop when ingredient is in a pawn inventory. Fixes surgery with [i]Smart Medicine[/i], compatibility with [i]Build From Inventory[/i], and others.

  - at: 2.0.0
    credit: 'Kellogg''s#0574'
    haul_to_equal_priority: &haulToEqualPriority Allow "Optimize hauling" to same-priority
    desc: |-
      • [i]Optimize hauling ingredients/supplies[/i] will trigger more often:
           - Fixed hauling from existing storage, not just un-stored.
           - New [i]{haul_to_equal_priority}[/i] setting (off by default, see info).
           - Checks closest storage (to destination, not item) for closeness to destination.

  # wrapping issues in HugsLib news from e.g. "Prefix " instead of "Prefix"
  - at: 2.0.0
    desc: |-
      • Added "Optimally" and "Efficiently unloading" job prefixes (like "Opportunistically").
      • Updated "Draw opportunistic jobs" to include optimized hauls (magenta & cyan).
      • Updated for RimWorld 1.3.

  - at: 2.1.0
    desc: |-
      • Improving storage mod compatibility:
        - Added "Stockpiles only" setting (on by default).
        - Changed 'Allow "Optimize hauling" to same-priority' to only deliver to stockpiles.
            Automatically turned on (new default). Disable it manually if issues.
        - Switched to vanilla-style settings window (future room for a storage building allow-list).

      • Setting for "Draw opportunistic & optimal jobs" is now saved.
          Try it out, it's fun! See tooltip for description.

  - at: 2.1.1
    credit: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198110437158
    desc: |-
      • Fixed hauling loop issue with PUAH, chunks, and multiple dumping stockpiles.

  - at: 2.1.2
    credit: https://steamcommunity.com/id/macbuk
    desc: |-
      • Fixed inventory hauling check to work with non-Pawns (e.g. [i]Misc. Robots[/i] mod).

settings:
  - name: Enabled
    title: Enabled
    desc: |-
      Toggle mod without restarting.

      Off is equivalent to disabling all features, resetting each vanilla parameter, and "initial closeness" set to "(vanilla)".

  - name: StockpilesOnly
    title: Stockpiles only
    desc: |-
      Only work with stockpiles. (There will be an allow-list for all building storage in the future.)

  - name: HaulToInventory
    title: Use & improve Pick Up And Haul
    desc: |-
      Controls both efficient unloading and using inventory for opportunistic hauls.

  - name: HaulToEqualPriority
    title: *haulToEqualPriority
    desc: |-
      This modifies "Optimize hauling" to include delivery to stockpiles (only) of same-priority storage.

  - name: HaulProximities
    title: Haulable & storage initial closeness
    desc: |-
      For performance reasons vanilla doesn't calculate and sort all haul paths to find opportunities, instead it settles for the first found with a haulable near our starting position, and its storage near our job destination. I've made these parameters configurable (marked with ¹).

      Since other parameters do well in limiting travel distance (marked with ²) we can change this from a requirement to simply a preference for closer hauls.

      If performance is an issue, set this stricter to reduce available hauls.
      If straight-line distance poorly represents your actual haul paths, set this stricter and adjust "max region look count"¹.

  - name: HaulProximities_Both
    title: Both required (vanilla)
  - name: HaulProximities_Either
    title: Either required
  - name: HaulProximities_Ignored

  - name: DrawOpportunisticJobs
    title: Draw opportunistic & optimal jobs
    desc: |-
      Original job paths are red, new opportunistic paths are green.
      Original ingredient/supply paths are magenta, new optimal paths are cyan.

      (This is sync'd to vanilla's [i]Development mode → inspector icon → Visibility → Draw Opportunistic Jobs[/i].)

  - name: ShowVanillaParameters
    title: Show opportunity parameters…
    desc: |-
      These settings are provided for explaining and tweaking vanilla's built-in opportunistic hauling.

      A value of 0 will skip a check.

  - name: MaxNewLegsPctOrigTrip
    title: ²Max new legs % of original trip

      This is straight-line distance ("as the crow flies").
    desc: |-
      Max start-to-haulable + storage-to-job % of original trip.

  - name: MaxStartToThingRegionLookCount
    title: ¹Max start-to-haulable region look count
    desc: &region_look_count |-
      This parameter limits our actual pathing.
      To understand it, enable [i]Development mode → inspector icon → Visibility → Draw Regions[/i].

      Exploration begins from the start region spreading out to all neighbors until encountering the destination region. This setting caps the total number explored - even those in the wrong direction.

      It can't be calculated perfectly from distance, as regions will vary in size and neighbors. (A corridor has only forward and back, so they're explored further.)
      But in a completely open field, if a pawn must travel the distance of n=3 full-sized 12x12 regions (~36 tiles), the algorithm will explore 2(n^2+n)+1 or 25 regions.
