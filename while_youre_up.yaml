intro: |-
  [b]Opportunistic hauling. Haul-to-inventory improvements (if [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279012058]Pick Up And Haul[/url] is installed).[/b]
  A must-have with PUAH. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.

  [h1]Description[/h1]
  {is_steam?=[img]https&#58;//i.imgur.com/neL6g6Q.png[/img]}
  
  Much of this mod is improving [i]Pick Up And Haul[/i] (optional; installed separately). If you already use PUAH, you want this mod too.

  "But my pawns are walking farther!"
  Yes. A slightly longer journey now to avoid a [i]much[/i] longer journey next time.

footer: |-
  [h1]Compatibility[/h1]
  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1561769193][i]Common Sense[/i][/url]? Yes. (I prevent incompatible settings from being on at the same time.)
  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896][i]LWM's Deep Storage[/i][/url]? Yes. But off by default for [i]Opportunities[/i] because storing items takes time.
  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341486509][i]Perfect Pathfinding[/i][/url]? I expect WYU's [i]Pathfinding[/i] setting to be compatible, but haven't tested.

  [i]@Modders:[/i] if you set [i]allowOpportunisticPrefix[/i] to [i]false[/i] for a JobDef, it won't allow opportunistic jobs. This is a vanilla feature.


  [h1]Performance[/h1]
  Vanilla's opportunistic hauling was well-optimized for performance, which this mod painstakingly preserves in its enhancements.
  Likewise we aggressively cache all haul destination lookups for all features, even base Pick Up And Haul.
  
  [img]https://i.imgur.com/NXaruPi.png[/img]


  [h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
  • Enable [i]Draw colored path detours[/i] in settings.
  • Pay attention to job descriptions, is it "on the way to" or "closer to"?
    ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=826998327]Moody[/url] can display them all.)
  • Remember you can disable features without restarting.


  [h1]Get It Fixed[/h1]
  1. Please save a game when a bug occurs, then reload to verify it reoccurs.
  2. Disable the mod from its own options menu - did the bug stop? If so...
  3. [url={discord}]Send me[/url] your save ([i]Options → Open save data folder[/i]). (They zip much smaller.)
  [b]I can now fix your bug in [i]days[/i] instead of [i]months[/i]! 🎉🥳[/b]


  [h1]History[/h1]
  I intended to [url=https://gist.github.com/CodeOptimist/5a740dd803fc370ec43f22ffa8bc953d#file-utils-cs-L48]fork[/url] the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544626521]While You're Up[/url], until I saw [url=https://github.com/CodeOptimist/rimworld-jobs-of-opportunity/blob/29391b0a075a1dd77d4788777b0137e26390328c/Source/Patch_TryOpportunisticJob.cs]RimWorld 1.0 added it[/url]. This mod improves vanilla's integration, and so is a spiritual successor to the original [i]While You're Up[/i] 💜.

      v4 [b]GET THE HECK TO WORK[/b] EDITION
      
      [i]Hauling fixes[/i]
      • Fixed chains of opportunity -> unload -> opportunity.
      • Also fixed back-to-back opportunistic hauls.
      • By default, perform a final pathfinding check: if it fails, no opportunity.
        (Never a bad haul again; mountain bases rejoice!)
      • During unloading, if our cell became occupied and the next is too far, drop items. (Rare. Better than alternatives.)
      • Prefer stockpiles not closest to [i]thing[/i] (pre-v3), not closest to [i]job[/i] (pre-v4), but closest to [i]midway[/i] between thing and job!
      
      [i]Other[/i]
      • Major reorganization and documentation improvement of entire codebase.
      • Added "Make colony (While You're Up)" to [i]Debug actions menu: Autotests[/i] (save your game first). 
      • Better debug visualization of pawn detours. Enabled from options.
      • New dedicated "Hauls of Opportunity: Advanced Settings" tab with colors, arrows, and thorough explanations. You won't need it, but it's beautiful!
      • Performance improvement and simplification from reduction in unnecessary object-oriented-ness.
      • Performance improvement from using `DistanceToSquared` in some places.
      
      [i]As my final act before retiring from RimWorld, possibly the last you'll hear from me: I want to share my journey from depression to an overwhelmingly fulfilling life. I can't guarantee it will help, but I can promise it's a route unlike anything you've ever read, and the only one that would have ever helped me escape:[/i] Read my writings at WEIRDIST.COM. Thanks everyone. <3 -Chris

      To understand this, enable [i]Development mode → inspector icon → Visibility → Draw Regions[/i].

      Exploration begins from the start region spreading out to all neighbors until encountering the destination region. This setting caps the total number explored - even those in the wrong direction.

      It can't be calculated perfectly from distance, as regions will vary in size and neighbors. (A corridor has only forward and back, so they're explored further.)
      But in a completely open field, if a pawn must travel the distance of n=3 full-sized 12x12 regions (~36 tiles), the algorithm will explore 2(n^2+n)+1 or 25 regions.
