  [b]Opportunistic hauling. Haul-to-inventory improvements (if [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279012058]Pick Up And Haul[/url] is installed).[/b]
  A must-have with PUAH. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.

  Much of this mod is improving [i]Pick Up And Haul[/i] (optional; installed separately). If you already use PUAH, you want this mod too.

  "But my pawns are walking farther!"
  Yes. A slightly longer journey now to avoid a [i]much[/i] longer journey next time.

  [h1]Compatibility[/h1]
  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1561769193][i]Common Sense[/i][/url]? Yes. (I prevent incompatible settings from being on at the same time.)
  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896][i]LWM's Deep Storage[/i][/url]? Yes. But off by default for [i]Opportunities[/i] because storing items takes time.
  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2341486509][i]Perfect Pathfinding[/i][/url]? Yes, both of our "Pathfind" settings should be compatible.

  [i]@Modders:[/i] You can set your JobDef to <allowOpportunisticPrefix>[i]true[/i]</...>. This is a vanilla feature.


  [h1]Performance[/h1]
  Vanilla's opportunistic hauling was well-optimized for performance, which this mod painstakingly preserves in its enhancements.
  Likewise we aggressively cache all haul destination lookups for all features, even base Pick Up And Haul.
  
  [img]https://i.imgur.com/NXaruPi.png[/img]


  [h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
  • Enable [i]Draw colored path detours[/i] in settings.
  • Pay attention to job descriptions, is it "on the way to" or "closer to"?
    ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=826998327]Moody[/url] can display them all.)
  • Remember you can disable features without restarting.

  [h1]History[/h1]
  I intended to [url=https://gist.github.com/CodeOptimist/5a740dd803fc370ec43f22ffa8bc953d#file-utils-cs-L48]fork[/url] the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544626521]While You're Up[/url], until I saw [url=https://github.com/CodeOptimist/rimworld-jobs-of-opportunity/blob/29391b0a075a1dd77d4788777b0137e26390328c/Source/Patch_TryOpportunisticJob.cs]RimWorld 1.0 added it[/url]. This mod improves vanilla's integration, and so is a spiritual successor to the original [i]While You're Up[/i] 💜.

v1_0_0: |
  [u]Opportunistic hauls[/u]
  Vanilla has support for opportunities, but with limitations: haulable near your [b]start[/b] position, and storage near your job.
  We prefer these, but drop them as requirements to include hauls along the path.

v1_1_0: |
  We skip opportunities when bleeding or forming a caravan.

v1_4_0: |
  Modified to grab only surrounding things whose unload path is also opportunistic.

v2_0_0: |
  [u][i]Pick Up And Haul+[/i]: Better unloading[/u]
  We enhance all inventory hauling by unloading only once at each storage destination, in closest order.
  We cache haulable destinations to improve performance.

v2_3_0: |
  [u]Storage building filters for mod compatibility[/u]
  Permit or deny for any storage building through settings, or leave automatically managed with mod updates.{is_steam?=
  
  [img]https&#58;//i.imgur.com/BIDFkJk.png[/img]
  }

v3_0_0: &v3_0_0 |-
  
  Modified to grab extra things headed to the same storage (when higher priority).
  Grab extra supplies & ingredients headed to the same storage (when equal priority).

        - Fixed unloading storage choice to match calculation for haul.
        - After closest storage, will unload by thing category like original PUAH.
        - Improved performance by caching haulable destinations.

      • Redesigned settings dialog.
      • Put job strings in XML for easier translation.

      v4 [b]GET THE HECK TO WORK[/b] EDITION
      
      [i]Hauling fixes[/i]
      • Fixed chains of opportunity -> unload -> opportunity.
      • Also fixed back-to-back opportunistic hauls.
      • By default, perform a final pathfinding check: if it fails, no opportunity.
        (Never a bad haul again; mountain bases rejoice!)
      • During unloading, if our cell became occupied and the next is too far, drop items. (Rare. Better than alternatives.)
      • Prefer stockpiles not closest to [i]thing[/i] (pre-v3), not closest to [i]job[/i] (pre-v4), but closest to [i]midway[/i] between thing and job!
      
      [i]Other[/i]
      • Major reorganization and documentation improvement of entire codebase.
      • Added "Make colony (While You're Up)" to [i]Debug actions menu: Autotests[/i] (save your game first). 
      • Better debug visualization of pawn detours. Enabled from options.
      • New dedicated "Hauls of Opportunity: Advanced Settings" tab with colors, arrows, and thorough explanations. You won't need it, but it's beautiful!
      • Performance improvement and simplification from reduction in unnecessary object-oriented-ness.
      • Performance improvement from using `DistanceToSquared` in some places.
      
      [i]As my final act before retiring from RimWorld, possibly the last you'll hear from me: I want to share my journey from depression to an overwhelmingly fulfilling life. I can't guarantee it will help, but I can promise it's a route unlike anything you've ever read, and the only one that would have ever helped me escape:[/i] Read my writings at WEIRDIST.COM.

      It can't be calculated perfectly from distance, as regions will vary in size and neighbors. (A corridor has only forward and back, so they're explored further.)
