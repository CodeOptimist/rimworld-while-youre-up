  <description><![CDATA[<b>Opportunistic hauling; haul-to-inventory improvements (if <i>Pick Up And Haul</i> is installed).</b>
A must-have with PUAH. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.
The following description is for RimWorld <b>1.4</b>.

Recognizing this mod: "on the way to", "closer to", "Efficiently unloading".

80% of this mod is improving <color=grey><b>Pick Up And Haul</b></color> (optional; installed separately). If you already use PUAH, you want this mod too.

"But my pawns are walking farther!"
Yes. A slightly longer journey now to avoid a <i>much</i> longer journey next time.

<color=teal><i>Pick Up And Haul+</i>: Better unloading</color>
We enhance all inventory hauling by unloading only once at each storage destination, in closest order.
We improve performance by caching haulable destinations.

<color=teal>Opportunistic hauls</color>
Vanilla has support for opportunities, but with limitations: haulable near your <b>start</b> position, and storage near your job.
We prefer these, but drop them as requirements to include hauls along the path.

We skip opportunities when bleeding or forming a caravan.

<i>Pick Up And Haul+</i>
Modified to grab only surrounding things whose unload path is also opportunistic.

<color=teal>Haul extra supplies & ingredients closer</color>
If hauling resources to storage would bring them closer to their job, do that first (grabbing extra).

<i>Pick Up And Haul+</i>
Modified to grab extra things headed to the same storage (when higher priority).
Grab extra supplies & ingredients headed to the same storage (when equal priority).

<color=teal>Storage building filters for mod compatibility</color>
Permit or deny for any storage building through settings, or leave automatically managed with mod updates.
